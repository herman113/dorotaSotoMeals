        <p class="paragraph paragraph__events">For many of us, holiday meals represent an either/or:  Either you go entirely off the rails or battle constant denial.</p>
        <p class="paragraph paragraph__events">What if you could just focus on what you love: taking time to enjoy friends and family, recharge, and share delicious food.  The holidays don't need to be a battle against your health and wellness goals.</p>
        <p class="paragraph paragraph__events">In this workshop, presented by <a href="https://www.leiadesousa.com/" target="_blank" class="leiaRed">Leia Desousa</a>, we'll explore your specific holiday challenges and develop targeted strategies for navigating them. Then we'll practice using these strategies with a delicious and healthy meal.</p>
        <p class="paragraph paragraph__events">You'll learn the perfect, satisfying portions of a balanced Thanksgiving meal, complete with a mocktail, a glass of wine and dessert (Vegans welcome!).</p>
        <p class="paragraph paragraph__events">You'll leave with a refreshed attitude, smart goals and a practical game plan -- as well healthy recipes fit for the most decadent holiday table. </p>
        <p class="paragraph paragraph__events">Let's align our aspirational selves with our family tables.  Join us!</p>
